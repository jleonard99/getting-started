Getting-Started
===============

The PDF (GettingStarted.pdf) contains the instructions.  The rest of the project was created 
to demonstrate how to use the different tools in preparing a PDF file team-style.

The purpose of this guide is to help new research team members get up
to speed with our common tools and practices.  Whether you are student pursuing
a degree, or researcher or full-time faculty member, you'll need to need to know
how to install and use the tools described in this document.

This is a living document, I welcome all team members to take part in it's 
evolution.  If nothing else, you'll get good practice working with the tools.
At best, you'll be helping everyone get better at doing what we need to do.
